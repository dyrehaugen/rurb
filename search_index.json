Recently the Corona virus COVID-19 has hit - overproportionally in densely populated urban areas. Urban Epidemics is an example of Urban Scaling. Urban Scaling can be positive - agglomeration economics of scale - or negative agglomeration diseconomics of scale - like the corona urban epidemic. As motivation we take this 3D map of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak in the US.

Imagine if we were to even just partially decommodify the housing stock by expanding public housing and capping the price of private housing at half its present level. Citizens would suddenly be able to work and earn significantly less than they presently do without any loss to their quality of life. The economy would produce less as a result, but it would also need much less. In such an economy private wealth (or GDP) may shrink reducing the incomes of corporations and the very rich, but public wealth would increase, significantly improving the lives of everyone else. And given the overwhelming scientific evidence on the limits of decoupling GDP growth from environmental impacts, this is the only way to meet our climate commitments. Mastini Memo Savini: A systemic imaginary of transition, degrowth is a ‘source of hope and dreams’ for a more equitable and sustainable society that has ‘exited the economy.’ Outlines three transitions toward urban degrowth, arguing for a regional imaginary of polycentric autonomism, a paradigm of finity in development, and care for habitability as principle of spatial organization. A degrowth perspective couples the critique of contemporary market economies with the prefiguration of a society emancipated from the imperative of competition. A degrowth imaginary begins from evidence indicating the impossibility of decoupling economic growth from environmental destruction Against the hegemony of growth in (eco)modernist thinking, degrowers call for a de- commodification of nature, labour, land, and housing and for an ethic of solidarity, coop- eration, and wellbeing. Against consumerism - a cultural shift toward values of buen vivir, sufficiency, and simplicity In sum, degrowth is a project of transitioning systematically toward a new society. First, the paper argues for an imaginary of regions as polycentric federations of autonomous settlements. Second, it calls for a planning paradigm led by principles of finity in urban development. Third, it proposes to mobilize the notion of habitability in shaping of socio-spatial relations. Rethink cities as dynamic sites of deceleration, regeneration, and redistribution. Urban degrowth research has largely demonstrated the capacity of real-life practices of urban dwelling to plant the seeds of a more cooperative, symbiotic and democratic urban society. Savini (pdf) "],["urban-epidemics.html", "3 Urban Epidemics", " 3 Urban Epidemics Social Distancing has become the mantra of policy response to the 2020 Corona Outbreak. Economic forces have for centruries pushed people closer and closer together in urban agglomerations. The emergence of a major pandemic in the 21th century - although forewarned - obviously was not a risk factor considered seriously by these same economic forces - neither private nor public decisionmakers when promoting and allowing the construction of the great agglomerations. Homo Sapiens was not made by nature to live in megacities. The corona outbreak is a piece of nature striking back as a reminder of the vulnerability of the artificial urban environment to the most basic of natural evolution - mutation of a virus. Stier (2020) provides an empirical treatment of the relation between urban size and the speed of epidemic spread in the US during the 2020 corona outbreak. The main findings are: faster spreading in larger cities larger fractions of the population infected more aggresive distancing needed The virus is new, i.e. everyone is susceptible. The virus provokes a respiratory disease which makes transmission easy. The reproductive number \\(R_{eff}\\) seems to be higher than for ordinary influenza. Two factors determine how contagious the disease is: 1)length of the infectious period and 2) social contact intensity. Cities are the best breeding ground due to the high contact intensity. The higher socioeconomic connectivity of larger cities in a fast urbanizing world makes containing emergent epidemics harder. But the density of socioeconomic connections in cities can also facilitate the spread of information, social coordination, and innovations necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19. This information and associated actions can easily spread much faster than the biological viral contagion. To fight an exponential, we need to create an even faster exponential! (Stier (2020)) So - the fight between Humans and Nature goes on! The bigger question - of course - being whether Humans should consider stopping creating such large [unhuman] agglomerations. There are many diseconomics to scale - epidemics being just one. Cities grow due to dominant economics of scale -i.e. benefitting the rich and powerful. The diseconomics are borne by others. Changing the current path does not seem easy - it goes to the core issue of Capitalism. This is treated elsewhere. Here we look into the more narrow theme of Urban Scaling "],["urban-scaling.html", "4 Urban Scaling 4.1 Scaling Laws - to the better or to the worse? 4.2 Scaling Math 4.3 Urban Catastrophes", " 4 Urban Scaling 4.1 Scaling Laws - to the better or to the worse? “Scaling laws are power-law relationships of the form \\(Y = cX^β\\), where \\(Y\\) represents a variable which varies in a systematic way with the size \\(X\\) of subsystems and \\(c\\) and \\(β\\) are parameters. They have two powerful advantages: they summarize structural features of systems in a very efficient way, and they reveal the effect of universal constraints acting on the structure and development over several orders of magnitude in these systems… The main resources enabling urban development are the technical and cultural innovations which increase the productivity, the diversity and the cohesion of human activities; the availability of these resources relies on the production and exchanges of information … The role of cities as centers for the integration of human capital and as incubators of invention was rediscovered by the “new” economic growth theory, which posits that knowledge spillovers among individuals and firms are the necessary underpinnings of growth (Lucas 1988, Romer 1986) … This seemingly spontaneous process, whereby knowledge produces growth and growth attracts knowledge, is the engine by which urban centers sustain their development through unfolding innovation. The essential role of knowledge generation, recombination and circulation within and across urban areas must be at the core of any proposed explanation for urban scaling.\" (Pumain 2006) There are however, other more critical views on the story of urban agglomeration. Naik and Oldfield (2015) Urbanisation inflicted by Capitalism Urbanization is seen as a an enterprise of The Urban Industry - a term for the ‘interlinked and interdependent relationships among NGOs, academia, business, high culture and governments’ that keeps afloat the story of ‘cities as centers of innovation, creativity, happiness, good health and, even astonishingly the cause and the solution for global warming.’ Naik and Oldfield present evidence to the quite contrary: ‘cities are in fact creators, incubators and perpetuators of poverty and inequality.’ Actually, as they say: ‘The urbanisation of the world should not be celebrated.’ 4.2 Scaling Math Urban Scaling Research finds that Social Contact Intensity is linked to City Size approximately as a power law: \\(k(N) = k_{0} N^β\\) with β = 1 + δ and δ ≈ 1/6 acording to Bettencourt. Fig 2. Power Law of Urban Scaling Fig 2 illustrates the power of scaling. The red line has δ = 0.15 and the green half of this, δ = 0.075. Both are cases of positive or superlinear scaling. For comparion δ can also be negative (sublinear), i.e.larger cities have smaller effects, as illustrated on the figure with δ = 0.85 (blue line). A scaling factor of δ = 0.15 is fairly strong: An urban area with 5 times the population - 1 million people compared to another with 200.000 people - has the double Social Contact Intensity. 10 times the population (2 million people) gives 4 times the intensity. ‘Social Contact Intensity’ - as we use it here - is an umbrella term. Many aspects of social and economic activity within urban areas will follow such power laws. Many empirical studies find power laws with β around 1.1 - 1.2 as a general charcteristic. As Bettencourt puts it: ‘Cities primary function is open-ended social reactors… [which] exist in similar, but changing forms over a huge range of scales… [and] evolve acording to a small set of principles that operate locally… [so that] the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities… [follow] scaling relations that apply to all urban systems.’ . 4.3 Urban Catastrophes The probabilities of electricity blackouts may be influenced by the sizes of cities more than by the details of power grids. Electric power blackouts can occur on all scales, from local outages to country-wide failures. The probability of a given event depends on the size of the region it affects, according to a mathematical relationship called a power law. The reason for the power law hasn’t been clear, but a new model suggests that it results from the same kind of distribution in the sizes of cities [1]. The model’s creators say that understanding the factors that influence blackout probabilities could help engineers make electricity grids more robust.

This mismatch has led to a phenomenon called “suburban retrofitting.” When the suburbs are retrofitted, they can take on an astonishing array of modern issues: car dependency, public health, supporting aging people, helping people compete for jobs, creating water and energy resilience, and helping with social equity and justice. Retrofitting Suburbia "],["urban-planning.html", "7 Urban Planning", " 7 Urban Planning Urban design offers countless examples of engineering solutions gone wrong. During the last century, transportation designers responded to traffic congestion by building more roads, bigger roads, smoother roads, freeways, roundabouts, and so forth. This approach led to cities designed for cars and produced greater congestion. The engineering mindset failed to consider the deeper, systemic context. Cars were a dubious idea in the first place, and the car culture was promoted by profiteers, not by a wise assessment of transportation options. In the 1930s, Standard Oil, General Motors, and Firestone Tire created a U.S. company, National City Lines, that bought public transportation systems and sabotaged them. They literally tore out light rail tracks and lobbied and bribed government officials around the world to build roads at public expense. Much of the world adopted a private car culture because that system benefited a few business elites, who wanted to increase profits. The engineering may have been brilliant, but the fundamental assumptions were wrong, or at least incomplete. Wicked Complexity "],["rent-gap.html", "8 Rent Gap", " 8 Rent Gap Abstract Clark:* The seeking of potential rents directs flows of investment into built and natural environments, suffusing volatility into urban and rural landscapes, generating gentrification and other forms of land use change, and displacing lives and livelihoods to make space for ‘improvement,’ ‘highest and best use,’ ‘revitalization,’ or the like. In this paper we argue that potential rents are captured at the cost of potential lives, and that rent gap theory, long central (and limited) to gentrification theory, is more widely applicable to the dynamics of land use change and uneven geographical development in capitalist societies. By reading David Harvey’s analyses of rent and accumulation by dispossession as a sophisticated formulation of rent gap theory, we relate the seeking and capturing of potential rents to the power of landed developer interests and a broadened con- ceptualization of rentiership. We furthermore relate the seeking of potential rents to an ideology of limitless accumulation, and the striving to rein in potential rents to ideas of degrowth and the need for a culture and a politics of limits. Brief vignettes from the ‘primary sector’ (fisheries in the Baltic Sea, dairy farming in Europe, and small-scale farming in Sweden) suggestively illustrate our central argument that the seeking and capturing of potential rents stand in stark opposition to potentials for wellbeing and flourishing of human and non-human lives. We conclude that con- straining potential rents – founded as they are on faith in limitless growth – requires a culture of self-limitation and politically imposed limitations commensurable with post-capitalist societies.

And when it’s a tropical country where convenience and air conditioning are a way of life, the impact could be greater still. Promising 42,000 new homes across five residential districts, the eco-town of Tengah – the Malay word for “middle,” though it’s in the island’s western region – will be the 24th new settlement built by Singapore’s government since World War II. It is, however, the first with centralized cooling, automated trash collection and a car-free town center, which conservationists hope offers a roadmap for slashing carbon emissions in the Southeast Asian city-state. Roads, parking and utilities are being pushed beneath the town center. \"We’re going for the ideal concept of segregation of traffic, (with) everything underground and then the ground level totally freed up for pedestrians. Although comparatively small, with a population of under 6 million people, Singapore’s per-capita emissions are higher than those of the UK, China and neighboring Malaysia. That’s due, in part, to air conditioning, which accounts for more than a third of typical household energy consumption. Global warming will only exacerbate this dependence. The Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) has predicted that, by the end of this century, average daily temperatures in the city-state may be at least 34.1 degrees Celsius (93.4 degrees Fahrenheit) “almost every day” during the eight warmest months of the year. Centralized Cooling Cold water, chilled using solar power, will be piped though the district’s homes, meaning residents don’t need to install inefficient outdoor AC condensers (though they can still control the temperature in their own apartments). This will generate carbon dioxide savings equivalent to taking 4,500 cars off the roads each year. Planners used computer modeling to simulate wind flow and heat gain across the town, helping to reduce the so-called urban heat island effect.

Could It Also Replace Capitalism? 20th century economic thinking is not equipped to deal with the 21st century reality It’s the first time a major city has attempted to put doughnut theory into action on a local level, but Amsterdam is not alone. Raworth says DEAL has received an avalanche of requests from municipal leaders and others seeking to build more resilient societies in the aftermath of COVID-19. Copenhagen’s city council majority decided to follow Amsterdam’s example in June, as did the Brussels region and the small city of Dunedin, New Zealand, in September, and Nanaimo, British Columbia, in December. In the U.S., Portland, Ore., is preparing to roll out its own version of the doughnut, and Austin may be close behind. The theory has won Raworth some high-profile fans; in November, Pope Francis endorsed her “fresh thinking,” while celebrated British naturalist Sir David Attenborough dedicated a chapter to the doughnut in his latest book, A Life on Our Planet, calling it “our species’ compass for the journey” to a sustainable future. The goal of getting “into the doughnut” should replace governments’ and economists’ pursuit of never-ending GDP growth. The primacy of GDP overinflated when we now have many other data sets to measure economic and social well-being Something that tries to grow endlessly we recognize as cancer. In 2019, C40, a network of 97 cities focused on climate action, asked Raworth to create reports on three of its members—Amsterdam, Philadelphia and Portland—showing how far they were from living inside the doughnut. For low- and middle-income countries to climb above the doughnut’s social foundation, “significant GDP growth is very much needed.” But that economic growth needs to be viewed as a means to reach social goals within ecological limits Citizen-led groups focused on the doughnut that are forming in places including São Paulo, Berlin, Kuala Lumpur and California bring the potential to transform their own areas from the bottom up. “It’s powerful when you have peers inspiring peers to act. Doughnut Amsterdam TimeMagazin C.3 210125 Attention-seeking Architecture Weird and wonderful buildings are springing up in China and elsewhere, driven by cities’ desire to make a mark in a world full of eye-popping imagery. Certain characteristics are shared, such as eye-popping imagery and curving architectural forms that stand out by virtue of being the last shapes you would come up with if you were only concerned with the practicalities of manufacture, assembly and engineering. There is the unsubtle wielding of natural and cultural symbolism – lotus flowers, the Himalayas, silk, shanshui. There is a passion for putting trees in the air, with a correlative unconcern about whether a storeys-high planter offers a comparable experience of nature to a park on the ground. Look and shape are everything. UrbanClick-Bait: The Sunac Guangzhou Grand Theatre - ‘Birthplace of the Silk Road on Sea’ The underlying factors are partly those that have always driven attention-seeking architecture, the desire of businesses and municipalities to advertise and sell themselves, the urge to make a mark, to glorify, to self-aggrandise. They are magnified by such things as (in the Arabian Gulf) the vast quantities of money available and (in China) the colossal scale at which urban developments are rolled out – the not-small Sunac Guangzhou Grand theatre turns out to be a maraschino cherry in the vast cocktail jug of theme parks, indoor ski slopes, water rides and the like that is the Sunac Wanda cultural tourism city. They are magnified again by technology, by the software that enables architects to visualise complex shapes and engineers to calculate them, by the photorealistic visualisation techniques that make a project seem physical before it is, by the construction techniques that turn these shapes into reality and, finally, by the internet’s crowded global marketplace of imagery.
